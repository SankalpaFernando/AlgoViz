## Contribution Guide
Prior to the contribution an issue should be raised and the contribution should be made in a seperate branch with the keyword of the issue  .This project use commitlint to enforce meaningful commits thus the commits should be in the form of  

    branch-commitNo: commit description
  
  Each Algorithm has its seperate file inside the **components** directory and the logic for the algorithm should be placed inside that file. The pages also should also contain a file regarding each algorithm and the logic component should be imported to this file.

Happy Contributing ðŸ‘‹
